1.1 We will create a new flag invoked by "ls -display." This is similar
to calling "ls -lh" but with a few more readability changes such as titles
and better formatting for the information being displayed. It will print
out a list of all the items in current directory, but in a modified "human
readable format."

1.2 This is a good idea as users need to easily understand what files are in the
directory they are dealing with and the information attached to those files. 
Displaying this information in a modified "human readable format" makes this much 
easier. Currently, the command that does this is not easily readable.
This defeats the purpose of such a command.

1.3 ls is the only module which we will be modifying.

1.4 NOT APPLICABLE
