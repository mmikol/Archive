CMSI 387 Operating Systems
   Semester Project
===================================

As we discussed, this will be a very good project!  I feel that the more
information you can give a user, the more effective that user can be in
getting the work done they need to do.

This project will also use your skills effectively to write the additional
functionality and then integrate it with the system.

Very useful idea!!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
