# Problems for Assignment #3

### 1. Write an implementation of the Dining Philosophers program, demonstrating deadlock avoidance.  

Answer:
```c++
//Code used from https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers#C
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
 
#define N 5
const char *names[N] = { "Aristotle", "Kant", "Spinoza", "Marx", "Russell" };
pthread_mutex_t forks[N];
 
#define M 5 /* think bubbles */
const char *topic[M] = { "Spaghetti!", "Life", "Universe", "Everything", "Bathroom" };
 
#define lock pthread_mutex_lock
#define unlock pthread_mutex_unlock
#define xy(x, y) printf("\033[%d;%dH", x, y)
#define clear_eol(x) print(x, 12, "\033[K")
void print(int y, int x, const char *fmt, ...)
{
	static pthread_mutex_t screen = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
	va_list ap;
	va_start(ap, fmt);
 
	lock(&screen);
	xy(y + 1, x), vprintf(fmt, ap);
	xy(N + 1, 1), fflush(stdout);
	unlock(&screen);
}
 
void eat(int id)
{
	int f[2], ration, i; /* forks */
	f[0] = f[1] = id;
 
	/* make some (but not all) philosophers leftie.
	   could have been f[!id] = (id + 1) %N; for example */
	f[id & 1] = (id + 1) % N;
 
	clear_eol(id);
	print(id, 12, "..oO (forks, need forks)");
 
	for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
		lock(forks + f[i]);
		if (!i) clear_eol(id);
 
		print(id, 12 + (f[i] != id) * 6, "fork%d", f[i]);
		/* delay 1 sec to clearly show the order of fork acquisition */
		sleep(1);
	}
 
	for (i = 0, ration = 3 + rand() % 8; i < ration; i++)
		print(id, 24 + i * 4, "nom"), sleep(1);
 
	/* done nomming, give up forks (order doesn't matter) */
	for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) unlock(forks + f[i]);
}
 
void think(int id)
{
	int i, t;
	char buf[64] = {0};
 
	do {
		clear_eol(id);
		sprintf(buf, "..oO (%s)", topic[t = rand() % M]);
 
		for (i = 0; buf[i]; i++) {
			print(id, i+12, "%c", buf[i]);
			if (i < 5) usleep(200000);
		}
		usleep(500000 + rand() % 1000000);
	} while (t);
}
 
void* philosophize(void *a)
{
	int id = *(int*)a;
	print(id, 1, "%10s", names[id]);
	while(1) think(id), eat(id);
}
 
int main()
{
	int i, id[N];
	pthread_t tid[N];
 
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		pthread_mutex_init(forks + (id[i] = i), 0);
 
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		pthread_create(tid + i, 0, philosophize, id + i);
 
	/* wait forever: the threads don't actually stop */
	return pthread_join(tid[0], 0);
}
```  

### 2. Write a short paragraph explaining why your program is immune to deadlock?  

Answer: This program is immune to deadlocks because it introduces the idea of hand dominance. If at least one philosopher tries to pick up their left fork first and another philosopher tries to pick up their right for, this will eventually avoid loops and therfore avoid deadlocks. The forks are held with semaphores, so two philosophers cannot hold the same fork at the same time.
  

### 3. Modify the file-processes.cpp program from Figure 8.2 on page 338 to simulate this shell command (write the code in C, not in C++):  
```
tr a-z A-Z < /etc/passwd
```

Answer:  
```c++
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main() {
  pid_t returnedValue = fork();
  if(returnedValue < 0){
    perror("error forking");
    return -1;
  } else if (returnedValue == 0) {
    if(close(STDIN_FILENO) < 0) {
      perror("error closing standard input");
      return -1;
    }
    if(open("/etc/passwd", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR) < 0){
      perror("error opening /etc/passwd");
      return -1;
    }
    execlp("tr", "tr", "a-z", "A-Z", NULL); // tr with options "a-z" and "A-Z"
    perror("error executing tr");
    return -1;
  } else {
    if(waitpid(returnedValue, 0, 0) < 0){
      perror("error waiting for child");
      return -1;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.  Write a program that opens a file in read-only mode and maps the entire file into the virtual-memory address space using mmap. The program should search through the bytes in the mapped region, testing whether any of them is equal to the character X. As soon as an X is found, the program should print a success message and exit. If the entire file is searched without finding an X, the program should report failure. Time your program on files of varying size, some of which have an X at the beginning, while others have an X only at the end or not at all.  

Answer:  

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        exit(-1);
    }
    
    char* file_name = argv[1];
    int fd = open(file_name, O_RDONLY);
    struct stat sb;
    
    if (fd == -1 || fstat(fd, &sb) == -1) {
        perror("Error! ");
        exit(-2);
    }
    
    char* mapped_file_ptr = mmap(NULL, sb.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    int found;
    for (int i = 0; i < sb.st_size; i++) {
        if (mapped_file_ptr[i] == 'X') {
            found = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    printf("'X' WAS%sfound!\n", (found) ? " " : " NOT ");
    munmap(mapped_file_ptr, sb.st_size);
    close(fd);
    
    exit(0);
}
```

### 5. Read enough of Chapter 10 to understand the following description: In the TopicServer implementation shown in Figures 10.9 and 10.10 on pages 456 and 457, the receive method invokes each subscriber's receive method. This means the TopicServer's receive method will not return to its caller until after all of the subscribers have received the message. Consider an alternative version of the TopicServer, in which the receive method simply places the message into a temporary holding area and hence can quickly return to its caller. Meanwhile, a separate thread running in the TopicServer repeatedly loops, retrieving messages from the holding area and sending each in turn to the subscribers. What Java class from Chapter 4 would be appropriate to use for the holding area? Describe the pattern of synchronization provided by that class in terms that are specific to this particular application.  

Answer:  

The Bounded Buffer Class would work because it allows two threads to work concurrently on receiving and sending. The pattern provided would be a pipeline synchronization with a producer (the thread placing a message in the buffer) and a consumer (the thread retrieiving the message from the buffer and sending each to the subscribers).
