==================================

Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points

Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points

Question 3 test program:            20/20 points
   It would have been nice to have this be a java program in your repo so
      I didn't have to retype it, but I compared it with my code and it
      looks OK, so I'm assuming the errors I got are from my typing...

Question 4 notifyall() addition:    10/10 points
   Same here as for question 3....  :)

Question 5a 2-phase locking:         5/ 5 points

Question 5b short read locks:        4/ 5 points
   No, it's not possible.  With read committed isolation, the writes will
      have exlusive locks, so T1 will have exclusive write access for the
      duration of the transaction.  Since write locks are exclusive, in this
      case it's the same outcome as with two-phase locking.

Question 5c snapshot isolation:      5/ 5 points

Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points

Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points

Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
   Again, having the code in your repo would be helpful.  Good write-up
      of the results!

Question 9 fork() tree:             15/15 points
   Nice job on this one, although you are showing some extra processes,
      I think.  PID:1 is most likely your terminal session which is not
      actually part of the fork() process.  Thus, 1090 isn't part of it,
      either.  The rest looks OK though.


Total 99 out of 100 = 99.00% which is an A-plus
